# Lecture Summary

This lecture provides an overview of the history of solutions to climate change.
We will discuss the COP system and group proposed solutions into technology and lifestyle changes.
For each, we will examine what the most impactful measures would be 
and potentially discuss some policy options for implementing them.

## Learning Objectives

1. Know different proposed lifestyle and technological solutions to climate change

2. Be able to critically evaluate the most common solutions to climate change in regards to possible impact and feasibility

3. Gain an overview of selected policy aimed at solving climate change at supra-national (COP) and national level

:::



Throughout this lecture, we will be focusing on mitigation of climate change.
On the other end, there are also a range of options, technical and lifestyle, for adapting for climate change.
We will not be discussing them today, which does not mean that they are less important, or unnecessary!

## Solutions relying on technology

Think about a bathtub that is full of water.
In order to stop it from overflowing you can either turn of the faucet, or open the drain at the bottom.
These two ways are essentially the same options we have to mitigate climate change.
In the climate bathtub, turning off the faucet means to stop adding new greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.
Since our planet already uses other sinks for greenhouse gases, the drain of the climate bathtub is already open.
Therefor, efforts to remove greenhouse gases from the atomosphere either focus on increasing the current drain, or on finding entirely new drains to open.

Technological solutions for both the faucet and the drain have been proposed and we will look at the most relevant ones below.
Let us start with finding additional drains.


## Solutions relying on technology

### Carbon Capture and Removal

### Clean Energy

### Clean Buildings

### Clean Consumption

#### Food

## Solutions relying on lifestyles

### Saving Energy

### Changing Mobility

### Changing Living

## Summary

@otto2020SocialTippingDynamics identify key social tipping dynamics and the time scales over which they are thought to work by surveying experts on climate change.
@fig-social_tipping shows the most relevant ones.
