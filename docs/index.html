<p>Think about a <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/infographic/worlds-apart/">bathtub that is full of water</a>. In order to stop it from overflowing you can either turn of the faucet, or open the drain at the bottom. These two ways are essentially the same options we have to mitigate climate change. In the climate bathtub, turning off the faucet means to stop adding new greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Since our planet already uses other sinks for greenhouse gases, the drain of the climate bathtub is already open. Therefor, efforts to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere either focus on increasing the current drain, or on finding entirely new drains to open.</p>
<section id="solutions-relying-on-technology" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="solutions-relying-on-technology">Solutions relying on technology</h2>
<p>Technological solutions for both the faucet and the drain have been proposed, and we will look at the most relevant ones below. Let us start with finding additional drains.</p>

<p>Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) is necessary to achieve net-zero CO2 and GHG emissions both globally and nationally, counterbalancing ‘hard-to-abate’ residual emissions. CDR is also an essential element of scenarios that limit warming to 1.5&nbsp;°C or below 2&nbsp;°C (&gt;67%) by 2100, regardless of whether global emissions reach near zero, net-zero or net negative levels <span class="citation" data-cites="pathak2022TechnicalSummary">(<a href="#ref-pathak2022TechnicalSummary" role="doc-biblioref">Pathak et al., 2022, p. 114</a>)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A lot to unpack here. Net-zero refers to the balance between the amount of greenhouse gas emissions produced, and the amount removed from the atmosphere, so that the overall emissions released into the atmosphere are zero. Hard-to-abate residual emissions mean the emissions that cannot be fully eliminated by current mitigation technologies. The scenarios that are mentioned are the IPCC’s way of expressing different possible pathways of future greenhouse gas emissions, which take into account various factors such as socio-economic development, energy use, and policy measures.</p>
<p>Using scenarios like this can help provide insights into what might happen, when reality is too complex to predict what will happen. This means that they are hypothetical and intended to explore and illustrate different possible futures based on a range of assumptions about factors such as population growth, economic development, and technology use. The scenarios range from very low to very high emissions and use a range of assumptions that may be grouped from reasonable to speculative <span class="citation" data-cites="warszawski2021AllOptionsNot">(<a href="#ref-warszawski2021AllOptionsNot" role="doc-biblioref">Warszawski et al., 2021</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>But there are a number of important aspects to note about Carbon Dioxide Removal.</p>
<p>Nature based methods for Carbon Dioxide Removal are potentially vulnerable to climate change outcomes, for example wetlands might dry up under droughts or increasing forest fires. They might also increase non-climate pressures on ecosystems, for example the amount of nitrogen in soils and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere. Additionally, there might be potential unintended consequences such as increasing global temperatures through a lower albedo, because forested land absorbs more of the sun’s energy than snow covered land due to the darker surface area. This might also impact water cycles, <span class="citation" data-cites="portmann2022GlobalForestationDeforestation">Portmann et al. (<a href="#ref-portmann2022GlobalForestationDeforestation" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> argue.</p>
<p>Technological Carbon Dioxide Removal methods require energy. Energy that needs to come from a carbon free source. Such energy is, however, needed elsewhere to reduce the carbon intensity of our energy usage. The carbon removed also needs to be stored somewhere. Most commonly geological reservoirs are proposed for this. But research on the acceptability and feasibility of this at scale is lacking.</p>
<p>For a list and comparison of Carbon Dioxide Removal options, their potentials and risk you can consult the table on pages 115-116 of <span class="citation" data-cites="pathak2022TechnicalSummary">Pathak et al. (<a href="#ref-pathak2022TechnicalSummary" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>. While Carbon Dioxide Removal may play a crucial role in the IPCC’s scenarios that limit warming to 1.5 and many of the scenarios that limit warming to under 2 degrees Celsius, their successful employment is uncertain <span class="citation" data-cites="pathak2022TechnicalSummary">(<a href="#ref-pathak2022TechnicalSummary" role="doc-biblioref">Pathak et al., 2022, p. 113</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>It appears that the drain of our climate bathtub is largely set. If we want to stop the bathtub from overflowing, let us then turn to actions we can take to slow the inflow.</p>
<p>We will review the highest impact solutions for each of the biggest sectors.</p>

<p>Which sectors are the biggest contributors to climate change?</p>

<!--  One approach is to dramatically reduce and electrify energy demand for transportation and manufacturing to levels that make residual non-electric fuel use negligible or replaceable by limited amounts of electrolytic hydrogen. Such an approach is presented in a first-of-its kind low-energy-demand scenario (Grubler et al., 2018)
which is part of this assessment. Other approaches rely less on energy demand reductions, but employ cheap renewable electricity to push the boundaries of electrification in the industry and transport sectors (Breyer et al., 2017; Jacobson, 2017)
. In addition, these approaches deploy renewable-based Power-2-X (read: Power to “x”) technologies to substitute residual fossil-fuel use (Brynolf et al., 2018)
. An important element of carbon-neutral Power-2-X applications is the combination of hydrogen generated from renewable electricity and CO2 captured from the atmosphere (Zeman and Keith, 2008)
. Alternatively, algae are considered as a bioenergy source with more limited implications for land use and agricultural systems than energy crops (Williams and Laurens, 2010; Walsh et al., 2016; Greene et al., 2017)

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="food-systems">Food Systems</h3>
<p>Although food systems are not one of the biggest sectors, it makes sense to discuss technological solutions for their corresponding sector agriculture and agroforestry through this lens. Mainly because the sixth IPCC Assessment Report has concrete technological ideas for food systems.</p>
<p>It states:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Emerging food technologies such as cellular fermentation, cultured meat, plant-based alternatives to animal-based food products, and controlled environment agriculture, can bring substantial reduction in direct GHG emissions from food production (limited evidence, high agreement).</strong> These technologies have lower land, water, and nutrient footprints, and address concerns over animal welfare. Realizing the full mitigation potential depends on access to low-carbon energy as some emerging technologies are relatively more energy intensive <span class="citation" data-cites="pathak2022TechnicalSummary">(<a href="#ref-pathak2022TechnicalSummary" role="doc-biblioref">Pathak et al., 2022, p. 113</a>)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The report also stresses that in order to realize the potential, changes across the entire supply chain are needed, including waste management. This includes changes in growing of food, processing of food, its transport and disposal. The technologies involved range from digitalization or different coolants to gene technology <span class="citation" data-cites="pathak2022TechnicalSummary">(<a href="#ref-pathak2022TechnicalSummary" role="doc-biblioref">Pathak et al., 2022, pp. 111–112</a>)</span>.</p>
</section>
<section id="mobility" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mobility">Mobility</h3>
<p>The main takeaway for technological solutions to mobility is that we need to switch to electricity powered vehicles where-ever possible. Where this is too difficult or impossible, such as in the aviation industry, alternatives such as biofuels, hydrogen or synthetic fuels may be an alternative, if they are produces with low or no carbon emissions.</p>
<p>As the current types of lithium-ion batteries depend on rare metals, issues related to their mining arise from a wide adoption. On this issue, the IPCC highlights that lithium-ion batteries have a high potential to be recycled and closed systems for batteries may help alleviate pressures, but will not remove them entirely.</p>
<p>Frequently in this discussion you will hear people bring up these alternatives as fuel for individual person transport (cars). While this might seem like a promising idea, the IPCC places more emphasis on those as alternatives more urgently needed in those ‘hard-to-abate’ parts of the transport sector, such as flying, long-haul heavy-duty transport, shipping <span class="citation" data-cites="pathak2022TechnicalSummary">(<a href="#ref-pathak2022TechnicalSummary" role="doc-biblioref">Pathak et al., 2022, p. 99</a>)</span>.</p>

<section id="buildings-and-housing" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="buildings-and-housing">Buildings and Housing</h3>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Global GHG emissions from buildings were 12 GtCO2-eq in 2019, equivalent to 21% of global GHG emissions. Of this, 57% (6.8 GtCO2-eq) were indirect emissions from off-site generation of electricity and heat, 24% (2.9 GtCO2-eq) were direct emissions produced on-site and 18% (2.2 GtCO2-eq) were embodied emissions from the production of cement and steel used in buildings (high confidence) <span class="citation" data-cites="pathak2022TechnicalSummary">(<a href="#ref-pathak2022TechnicalSummary" role="doc-biblioref">Pathak et al., 2022, p. 100</a>)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is a lot! Notice that about half of buildings emissions come from the consumption of electricity and heat.</p>
<p>For building and housing the technological solutions begin at the design phase. We need to take the lifetime of buildings into account and design them accordingly. For example, Malmö City is building a sharing community at Sege Park. They realize that people currently still need and want cars for mobility. Accordingly, they have built a parking garage for those cars. However, they have strategic plans to reduce car ownership across the entire city and have therefore designed the parking garage in a modular way that can be changed to meet new demands. You can read more about this on the <a href="https://www.pmalmo.se/Om-parkering-Malmo/vart-uppdrag/vi-bygger/byggprojekt-i-sege-park/">website for Sege Park (in Swedish)</a>.</p>
<p>The second big principle for housing is to construct them with low-emission materials and for high efficiency using renewable energy. This means substituting cement and steel for wood, installing renewable energy from the start, and ensuring high standards when it comes to insulation.</p>
<p>Where buildings already exist, the IPCC focuses on optimizing the use and supply of energy. For example, where fossil fuels such as gas are used to provide heating for the building, replacing these technologies with, for example, electricity driven heat-pumps. In addition to this optimization of the supply of energy, houses can be retroactively insulated, or outfitted with smart meters to optimize the energy they consume.</p>
<p>Lastly, new technology to reuse and recycle buildings is needed. In the example of the parking garage in Malmö above, the reuse of constructing elements has already been considered during the design phase of the building.</p>
</section>
<section id="industry" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="industry">Industry</h3>
<p>And then there is industry. The overview of this lecture is too short to really dig into technological solutions across industry. Instead, note in the following answer to the Frequently Asked Question “What are the key options to reduce industrial emissions?”, the call on several strategies at once.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What are the key options to reduce industrial emissions? Industry has a diverse set of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission sources across subsectors. To decarbonise industry requires that we pursue several options simultaneously. These include energy efficiency, materials demand management, improving materials efficiency, more circular material flows, electrification, as well as carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) and carbon capture and storage (CCS). Improved materials efficiency and recycling reduces the need for primary resource extraction and the energy-intensive primary processing steps. Future recycling may include chemical recycling of plastics if quality requirements make mechanical recycling difficult. One approach, albeit energy intensive, is to break down waste plastics to produce new monomer building blocks, potentially based on biogenic carbon and hydrogen instead of fossil feedstock. Hydrogen can also be used as a reduction agent instead of coke and coal in ironmaking. Process emissions from cement production can be captured and stored or used as feedstock for chemicals and materials. Electricity and hydrogen needs can be very large but the potential for renewable electricity, possibly in combination with other low carbon options, is not a limiting factor <span class="citation" data-cites="bashmakov2022Industry">(<a href="#ref-bashmakov2022Industry" role="doc-biblioref">Bashmakov et al., 2022, p. 1223</a>)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice the pattern across all sectors. We need to shift to low carbon alternatives where-ever possible. Where that is not (yet) possible, we must improve the efficiency of existing technology. This shift to cleaner alternatives implies that we need low-carbon intensity energy.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary-of-technological-solutions">Summary of technological solutions</h3>
<p>This very high level overview of different technological solutions in the main sectors should highlight three things to you. First, technological solutions exist. The general idea for virtually all of them is to shift to non-carbon energy sources and to improve the efficiency of their end use. Second, these changes sound easier on paper than in reality. All this clean energy needs to be produced somewhere, and then it needs to get to where it is needed. Building and changing infrastructure and physical capital is going to require substantial financial and labor efforts. Lastly, even if we adopt all the technological solutions there will have to be changes in lifestyle as well. Installing new heating systems will only take us so far in decarbonizing housing, if people in response turn up the thermostat.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="individuals-often-focus-on-changing-low-impact-behaviors">Individuals often focus on changing low-impact behaviors</h3>
<p>Researchers from Lund University have analyzed a broad range of government and educational recommendations for individual mitigation behavior. They discovered that what people think – and are recommended to do – and what actually has a big impact on individual CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are often not the same. Instead of focusing on small impact actions such as turning off lights, individual behavior should focus on big impact actions such as flying less, living car free and switching to a plant based diet <span class="citation" data-cites="wynes2017ClimateMitigationGap">(<a href="#ref-wynes2017ClimateMitigationGap" role="doc-biblioref">Wynes &amp; Nicholas, 2017</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The study also found that the decision with the biggest impact on an individual’s climate footprint is how many children to have. In her book <em>Under the Sky We Make</em> Kimberley <span class="citation" data-cites="nicholas2021SkyWeMake">Nicholas (<a href="#ref-nicholas2021SkyWeMake" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> expands on this finding with reflections on the media coverage. In the media, the statement that deciding how many children to have is a big impact decision was sometimes represented along the lines of “Scientist want you to have fewer children!”. However, what she explains in her book, and what might be a good rule of thumb for all these decisions is: think about the impact that a decision you make has. It will not be possible to reduce your carbon emissions to zero, so you must decide where, when and how to allocate your emissions.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="akenji2021DegreeLifestylesFair">Akenji et al. (<a href="#ref-akenji2021DegreeLifestylesFair" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> estimate that your personal lifestyle carbon footprint – meaning the amount of carbon per capita that is compatible with staying within the global carbon budget to limit warming to well below 1.5 degrees Celsius without relying on negative emission technologies –<br>
needs to be reduced to only 0.7 tonnes CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent by 2050. By 2030, the report estimates that we need to reduce per capita carbon footprints of lifestyles to approximately 2.5 tCO<sub>2</sub>eq (p.&nbsp;42). If you are interested in learning more about your own carbon footprint, there are a number of calculators available online. Be aware that they make certain assumptions, for example, about the carbon intensity of a country’s energy mix.

<p>A major argument of <span class="citation" data-cites="newell2021ScalingBehaviourChange">Newell et al. (<a href="#ref-newell2021ScalingBehaviourChange" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> is that the context in which we expect lifestyles to change needs to be considered. Approaches that focus on behavior change alone, overlook that people are subject to choice constraints. For example, being able to purchase ecological produce at the supermarket requires not only the financial means to do so, but also the availability of ecological products. Changing mobility behaviors from cars to public transport requires there to be feasible public transport options.</p>
<p>If we relate this once again to <a href="#fig-country_targets">Figure&nbsp;1</a> it becomes even clearer that the context in which people are asked to make lifestyle changes matters a lot. This context includes formal and informal institutions, infrastructure, habits and more.

<p>There is one more aspect that should be highlighted when discussing lifestyle changes. That is a strong correlation between affluence and environmental pollution. One way of looking at this is the Environmental Kuznet’s Curve, which was covered earlier in the course. Another way to look at this is to examine pollution on an individual basis, instead of a country level.</p>

While the poorest 50% of the world have only contributed 7% of cumulative emissions between 1990 and 2015, the global top 10% are responsible for emitting 52% of cumulative emissions in the same time period. It is this small amount of people which is sometimes referred to as the polluter elite. The 630 million people that make up the 10% must make the most drastic changes to their current lifestyles, which includes but is not limited to, flying less, giving up SUVs, investing their money in more responsible assets.</p>

<p>Lifestyle changes are necessary to mitigate climate change. People can make decisions with big impacts on their personal carbon footprint, but keeping track of them at all times is challenging.</p>
<p>The framework <span class="citation" data-cites="creutzig2022DemandsideSolutionsClimate">Creutzig et al. (<a href="#ref-creutzig2022DemandsideSolutionsClimate" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> propose might be a good heuristic if in doubt:</p>
<p><strong>Avoid, Shift, Improve</strong>.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Here, we generalize ‘avoid’ to all mitigation options that reduce wasteful energy consumption by redesigning service provisioning systems; ‘shift’ to the switch to already existing competitive low-carbon technologies and service provisioning systems; and ‘improve’ to improvements in efficiency in existing technologies where adoption by end users plays an important role. <span class="citation" data-cites="creutzig2022DemandsideSolutionsClimate">(<a href="#ref-creutzig2022DemandsideSolutionsClimate" role="doc-biblioref">Creutzig et al., 2022, p. 37</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>But placing the burden of these changes on individual behavior alone is problematic because it underestimates the role that context plays in individual agency.

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="policy">Policy</h2>
<p>Governments at all levels have a crucial role to play in addressing this global crisis, and this subsection will focus on the policies that can be implemented to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming. Specifically, we will explore some key strategies and initiatives that are being pursued at the supranational and national levels, as well as the role of climate litigation in holding governments and corporations accountable for their contributions to climate change</p>
<p>But before that, some good news. The IPCC reports that half of the worlds emissions are covered by laws and policies around the globe already <span class="citation" data-cites="pathak2022TechnicalSummary">(<a href="#ref-pathak2022TechnicalSummary" role="doc-biblioref">Pathak et al., 2022</a>)</span>.</p>

<section id="supra-national" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="supra-national">Supra-National</h3>
<p>Supranational policies are those that are developed and implemented by international organizations or agreements that involve multiple countries. These policies can be important tools for addressing climate change, as they can help to coordinate action and establish global standards for emissions reductions. One example of those, was already discussed earlier in the course: the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)</a>.</p>
<p>Here, we will take a look at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the Conference of Parties (COP).</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The UNFCCC entered into force on 21 March 1994. Today, it has near-universal membership. The 198 countries that have ratified the Convention are called Parties to the Convention.

<p>The IPCC is a scientific body that was established by the UN in 1988. It provides policymakers with regular assessments of the scientific basis of climate change, its impacts, and options for mitigation and adaptation. The IPCC is composed of hundreds of scientists from around the world who volunteer their time to assess the latest scientific research on climate change. Its assessments are widely regarded as the most authoritative source of information on climate change and are used by governments and organizations around the world to inform their policy decisions. This lecture makes extensive use of the Sixth Assessment Report, especially in the first section.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Conference of the Parties (COP) is the governing body of the UNFCCC. It is made up of representatives from all countries that are party to the convention and meets annually to assess progress in dealing with climate change and to negotiate and adopt new measures to address it. The most significant COP was COP21, which resulted in the adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015.</p>
<p>Together, the UNFCCC, IPCC, and COP provide a comprehensive framework for addressing climate change at the international level. The UNFCCC sets the overall objective and legal framework, the IPCC provides the scientific basis for action, and the COP negotiates and adopts measures to achieve the objectives of the UNFCCC.</p>
<section id="the-paris-agreement-in-2015" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-paris-agreement-in-2015">The Paris Agreement in 2015</h4>
<p>The Paris Agreement, which was adopted in 2015, was a breakthrough milestone in the global response to climate change. It recognized for the first time that climate change requires a global response with mitigation action from all countries. The agreed goal of this effort is to limit global warming to well below 2&nbsp;°C above pre-industrial levels, with a goal of limiting warming to 1.5&nbsp;°C. And, importantly, it established a legally binding framework for all countries that ratified the agreement, with continuously updated targets and evaluations, the so called Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).</p>

</section>
<section id="national-policies" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="national-policies">National Policies</h3>
<p>These contributions can be pursued through national, regional and municipal policies. Here we will focus on some of the most often discussed policy schemes instead of individual policies. The policies are loosely grouped into three categories: economic policies, regulatory policies and systemic policies. Please note that this taxonomy is not very strict and policies might well be grouped differently or belong to multiple groups.</p>
<section id="economic" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="economic">Economic</h4>
<p>The most common economic policy proposals include a carbon tax, emission cap and trade schemes and subsidies for low carbon options.</p>
<p>A carbon tax is a type of tax that is levied on the production, distribution, or use of fossil fuels based on the amount of carbon dioxide they emit. By making fossil fuels more expensive, a carbon tax can incentivize individuals and businesses to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>Emission cap and trade schemes are similar in that they aim to correct a market failure by internalizing some social costs of carbon. This policy involves setting a limit (cap) on the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions that can be released by a particular sector or country. Companies or countries are then allowed to trade emissions allowances, which provides an economic incentive to reduce emissions.</p>
<p>These two policies are often criticized as economically unfair. The consequence putting a price on Greenhouse Gas (GHG) pollution is that prices of products and services which are responsible for their emission also go up. This can affect low income households more than richer households, and might make them politically contested. Research on the acceptability of price policy suggests that such concerns are not warranted if the policy includes a counterbalancing mechanism <span class="citation" data-cites="maestre-andres2019PerceivedFairnessPublic">(<a href="#ref-maestre-andres2019PerceivedFairnessPublic" role="doc-biblioref">Maestre-Andrés et al., 2019</a>)</span>. For example, every person could receive a climate dividend based on the sustainable carbon budget per capita, or the revenue could be used only for promoting low carbon alternatives.</p>
<p>The promotion of low carbon alternatives could, for example, happen through specific subsidies.</p>
</section>
<section id="regulatory" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="regulatory">Regulatory</h4>
<p>But there are other non-market based policy options available as well.</p>
<p>Policymakers could use choice editing to changing the default options or incentives in order to encourage individuals and businesses to make more sustainable choices. For example, Germany plans to prohibit the installation of heating units running on fossil gas in 2024. This would remove a choice from consumers increasing the roll-out of low-carbon alternatives such as heat pumps.</p>
<p>Big potential also comes from the protection and conservation of nature. Apart from ensuring that existing carbon sinks are not subjected to even more pressure this can have various co-benefits, for example for biodiversity.</p>
</section>
<section id="systemic" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="systemic">Systemic</h4>
<p>Lastly, there are more systemic policy alternatives that receive a lot of attention. This includes Degrowth and the Doughnut Economy, to name only two examples which have been already discussed in more depth in this course. Rather than being individual policies these are interconnected and deeper changes to the goals, functions and methods by which policy makers act.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Climate change is a massive challenge for our civilization. It can often feel daunting and impossible to solve, but solutions do exists. In some cases we have a very good idea of what needs to happen, in others more research is needed. Hoping that any single action will be enough, or that we might be able to “fix it” using technology only is a very big and uncertain gamble.</p>
<p>Scaling changes in lifestyles needs to be mindful of both individual behavior change and deep transformations of social systems. This is especially true for the lifestyles of the minority that pollutes the most.</p>
<p>Legislation at various levels already exists to tackle climate change, but more is needed. Ambitious policy ideas have been developed from very concrete and specific solutions to broad and systematic approaches. The fact that litigation against climate inaction is increasingly on the agenda further highlights that many tools exist within our systems to be used against the fossil regime.</p>
<p>One last important aspect to be mindful of is so-called Carbon Tunnel Vision. Many of the solutions to climate change can have adverse outcomes on other planetary boundaries or the wellbeing of people. Wanting to increase the growth rate of photosynthesis sinks might make you want to use fertilizer. But this can have negative consequences on other ecosystem services and biodiversity levels. On the other hand, many solutions to climate change also have co-benefits for other environmental issues such as setting aside nature to be protected and conserved.</p>
<p>The need for change is urgent. But the possibility for it is large.</p>
