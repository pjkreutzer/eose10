### Food Systems

>[**Emerging food technologies such as [cellular fermentation, cultured meat, plant-based alternatives to animal-based food products, and controlled environment agriculture]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue}, can bring substantial reduction in direct GHG emissions from food production (limited evidence, high agreement).** These technologies have lower land, water, and nutrient footprints, and address concerns over animal welfare. Realising the full mitigation potential depends on access to low-carbon energy as some emerging technologies are relatively more energy intensive.]{.text-default}

###  Mobility

> [[...] [Electric vehicles powered by low-emissions electricity]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} offer the largest decarbonisation potential for land-based transport, on a life cycle basis (high confidence). Sustainable biofuels can offer additional mitigation benefits in land-based transport in the short and medium term (medium confidence).

[@shukla2022SummaryPolicymakers 28]{.slide-cite}

:::{.notes}
>Integrated design approaches to the construction and retrofit of buildings have led to increasing examples of zero energy or zero carbon buildings in several regions. However, the low renovation rates and low ambition of retrofitted buildings have hindered the decrease of emissions. Mitigation interventions at the design stage include buildings typology, form, and multi-functionality to allow for adjusting the size of buildings to the evolving needs of their users and repurposing unused existing buildings to avoid using GHG-intensive materials and additional land. Mitigation interventions include: at the construction phase, low-emission construction materials, highly efficient building envelope and the integration of renewable energy solutions;58 at the use phase, highly efficient appliances/equipment, the optimisation of the use of buildings and their supply with low-emission energy sources; and at the disposal phase, recycling and re-using construction materials. (high confidence)

[@shukla2022SummaryPolicymakers 28]

>In 2014, the buildings sector accounted for 31% of total global final energy use, 54% of final electricity demand, and 8% of energy-related CO2 emissions (excluding indirect emissions due to electricity). When upstream electricity generation is taken into account, buildings were responsible for 23% of global energy-related CO2 emissions, with one-third of those from direct fossil fuel consumption (IEA, 2017a)

### Industry

> [**Net zero CO2 industrial-sector emissions are possible but challenging (high confidence).** [Energy efficiency]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} will continue to be important. [Reduced materials demand, material efficiency, and circular economy solutions]{.fragment .highlight-current-blue} can reduce the need for primary production.]{.text-default}

[@pathak2022TechnicalSummary 104]{.slide-cite}

:::{.notes}
The use of steel, cement, plastics, and other materials is increasing globally, and in most regions. There are many
sustainable options for demand management, materials efficiency, and circular material flows that can contribute
to reduced emissions, but how these can be applied will vary across regions and different materials. These options
have a potential for being more used in industrial practice and would need more attention from industrial policy.
These options, as well as new production technologies, are generally not considered in recent global scenarios
nor in national economy-wide scenarios due to relative newness. As a consequence, the mitigation potential in
some scenarios is underestimated compared to bottom-up industry-specific models. (high confidence) {3.4, 5.3,

Often times you hear people debate if consumers or producers should take responsibility for reducing carbon emissions.
What do you think about this debate, motivate your answer with the criticism of @newell2021ScalingBehaviourChange that behavior is embedded in a social context.

Demand-side mitigation strategies technically could provide reductions of 78% (6.8 GtCO2e), 62% (5.8 GtCO2e), 41% (7.3 GtCO2e) and 41% (6.3 GtCO2e) in the buildings, transport, food and industry sectors, respectively (black dotted arrows). Urban strategies are merged with buildings and land transport strategies and are presented under ‘human settlements’ (red-dashed-line box). Transport demand-side mitigation strategies and potentials are grouped as land transport, shipping and aviation (purple-dashed-line box).

![](../assets/ipcc-figures/SPM.3.png){fig-alt="Unit cost reductions and use in some rapidly changing mitigation technologies. The top panel shows global costs per unit of energy (USD per MWh) for some rapidly changing mitigation technologies. Solid blue lines indicate average unit cost in each year. Light blue shaded areas show the range
between the 5th and 95th percentiles in each year. Grey shading indicates the range of unit costs for new fossil fuel (coal and gas) power in 2020 (corresponding to USD55–148 per MWh). In 2020, the levelised costs of energy (LCOE) of the four renewable energy technologies could compete with fossil fuels in many places. For batteries, costs shown are for 1 kWh of battery storage capacity; for the others, costs are LCOE, which includes installation, capital, operations, and maintenance costs per MWh of electricity produced. The literature uses LCOE because it allows consistent comparisons of cost trends across a diverse set of energy technologies to be made. However, it does not include the costs of grid integration or climate impacts. Further, LCOE does not take into account other environmental and social externalities that may modify the overall (monetary and non-monetary) costs of technologies and alter their deployment. The bottom panel shows cumulative global adoption for each technology, in GW of installed capacity for renewable energy and in millions of vehicles for battery-electric vehicles. A vertical dashed line is placed in 2010 to indicate the change since AR5. Shares of electricity produced and share of passenger vehicle fleet are indicated in text for 2020 based on provisional data, i.e., percentage of total electricity production (for PV, onshore wind, offshore wind, CSP) and of total stock of passenger vehicles (for EVs). The electricity production share reflects different capacity factors; for example, for the same amount of installed capacity, wind produces about twice as much electricity as solar PV. {2.5, 6.4} Renewable energy and battery technologies were selected as illustrative examples because they have recently shown rapid changes in costs and adoption, and because consistent data are available. Other mitigation options assessed in the report are not included as they do not meet these criteria [@ipccps 12]."}

:::{.notes}
(i) growth in the share of energy derived from low-carbon-emitting sources (including renewables, nuclear and fossil fuel with CCS) and a decline in the overall share of fossil fuels without CCS (Section 2.4.2.1), (ii) rapid decline in the carbon intensity of electricity generation simultaneous with further electrification of energy end-use (Section 2.4.2.2), and (iii) the growth in the use of CCS applied to fossil and biomass carbon in most 1.5°C pathways (Section 2.4.2.3).

Nuclear power increases its share in most 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot by 2050, but in some pathways both the absolute capacity and share of power from nuclear generators decrease (Table 2.15). There are large differences in nuclear power between models and across pathways (Kim et al., 2014; Rogelj et al., 2018)
. One of the reasons for this variation is that the future deployment of nuclear can be constrained by societal preferences assumed in narratives underlying the pathways (O’Neill et al., 2017; van Vuuren et al., 2017b)
. Some 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot no longer see a role for nuclear fission by the end of the century, while others project about 95 EJ yr−1 of nuclear power in 2100 (Figure 2.15).
